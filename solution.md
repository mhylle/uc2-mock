# Patient Management System

A React-based healthcare application designed to support health professionals in their patient consultations. The system implements a three-stage workflow:

1. Base Data: Contains the fundamental information about the citizen/patient
2. Pre-Meeting Preparation: Allows health professionals to review the patient's condition before meetings
3. Change Overview: Shows what has changed since the last consultation

The system helps health professionals to:
- Review patient baseline information
- Prepare for consultations by studying the patient's conditions beforehand
- Track and visualize changes in the patient's conditions over time
- Monitor multiple health conditions including diabetes, chronic pain, dementia, and COPD
- Access detailed information about treatments, follow-ups, and focus areas

This approach ensures that health professionals are well-prepared for patient meetings and can easily identify any changes or developments in the patient's conditions since their last interaction.
